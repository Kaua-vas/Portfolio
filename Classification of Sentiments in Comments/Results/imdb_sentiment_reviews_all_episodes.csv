Episode 1,"I had been looking forward to this show for a while, but was a little hesitant to watch it after seeing so many negative reviews. Had some time this evening to give it a shot, and I'm still processing what I just watched.It's not fair to judge a whole show off of one episode, but I have to say the start is not promising. Some characters (Master Sol) seem to fit and fill out their role well, others (Yord) feel incredibly forced. Dialogue is painful, and the special effects really don't seem too, well, ""special"". The worst part for me though is that this doesn't even feel like Star Wars.Having been on several of Disney's newer rides, it felt more like I was watching a play that was moving from one section of a theme park attraction to another. Camera angles were odd, sets looked detailed, but I didn't feel truly immersed in the story. This felt more like a junior high production than something with a Broadway-level budget.Not sure I'll be able to finish this one off, depending on how the next few episodes play out. I'll give it a try, but this feels like a show without the soul of Star Wars.",look forward little hesitant watch see negative review time evening shot process watch fair judge episode start promise character Master Sol fit fill role Yord feel incredibly force Dialogue painful special effect special bad feel like Star Wars having Disney new ride feel like watch play move section theme park attraction camera angle odd set look detailed feel truly immerse story feel like junior high production Broadway level budget sure able finish depend episode play try feel like soul Star Wars,POSITIVE,0.8635776042938232
Episode 1,"I love Star Wars. It's been a lifelong obsession and will stay with me forever. Have never got into the cartoons but I've seen every live action film and TV series multiple times. Of the new post Disney fare, I enjoyed The Force Awakens (but not Episodes 8 and 9 and certainly not Solo), and I loved the first 2 series of the Mandalorian, and adored every moment of Andor - for me the best Star Wars Universe live action output that's been created to date. Many of the other TV series have been damp squibs IMO - Kenobi, Ahsoka and Boba Fett (ruining my favourite SW character in the process).How does The Acolyte shape up in the above context? I watched 2 episodes and this review combines them. No plot spoilers required.For me there is a huge problem at the heart of The Acolyte which also affected Kenobi and Ahsoka and was similarly problematic for much of the Prequel Trilogy. We all love Jedi Knights. We love the Force. We love a bit of light saber action. But Jedi Knights are BY TRAINING calm and serene, relatively humourless and unemotional, no major mood swings or ups and downs, limited bitterness, anger, sadness, fear, passion - because those traits are trained out. At the extreme, dialogue between Jedi Knights is clunky, awkward, serious, worthy and stilted. I find Ahsoka a difficult watch because she plays every scene the same way - like a Buddhist monk in a Zen like state - no matter the peril, danger, etc. In The Acolyte we have dialogue between Jedi Knights for much of the story - where's the comic relief, where's the recklessness, where's the jeopardy and emotion? Much as with The Phantom Menace where dialogue between politicians is stilted, worthy and boring, dialogue between Jedi doesn't exactly get the juices flowing. For example, Dafne Keen is a brilliant actress (Logan, Dark Materials) but so far her dialogue and required Jedi delivery makes her comes across as simply reading lines.I hope this series turns out well - as a SW junkie I'll watch every minute - but IMO a non SW fan would find this a boring watch. The original films worked so well because you had Jedi (telling us the background story and providing moral leadership) surrounded by reluctant heroes (Luke, Han), comedy turns (the droids, Han), brave leaders (Leia), scoundrels (Han again), evil types - it worked because of that mix. And, of course, cool creatures, planets, vehicles etc. I'm missing most of that here.

Episode 1,"I wanted to like this, the first 5 mins were the highlight and it went downhill from there. No interest in the characters and stories. Overall just pretty boring. The quality of the new Star Wars shows has been uneven.

Episode 1,"Very much enjoyed the first episode, the action is well choreographed, sort of reminds me of the matrix and it does well to create intrigue with mystery and many different points of view. It does leave me unsure at this point in time what the necessity of this show will be, what it wants to tell us that we haven't discovered through previous projects, but I imagine in time we will find that out.Lee Jung-jae fits so perfectly into this universe and his line delivery has you hanging to his every word. You can feel Master Sol's regret and sympathy for Osha and whatever the situation was and it will be interesting to see exactly what those details are. Yord comes across as a bit of a people pleaser, desperate for approval at the moment, I'll be curious to see more to better understand him and also his connection to Osha which so far we only know they had from their first on screen interaction.",enjoy episode action choreograph sort remind matrix create intrigue mystery different point view leave unsure point time necessity want tell discover previous project imagine time find Lee Jung jae fit perfectly universe line delivery hang word feel Master Sol regret sympathy Osha situation interesting exactly detail Yord come bit people pleaser desperate approval moment curious well understand connection Osha far know screen interaction,POSITIVE,0.9958914518356323
Episode 1,"Wont go into spoilers. I'll get straight into this by saying that the writing and dialogue is so flat and at times really really bad here. There's so much clunky exposition to get the audience caught up and there's lots of failed attempts at humor. The acting is fine. The only ones who were somewhat good were the girl from Logan and the guy from Squid Game (Sorry, I don't know their names.) The cgi and sets range from not very good to pretty good. It looks better than kenobi and boba fett but nowhere near Andor and some of mando.The characters are completely hollow so far, and honestly so is the plot. There's just nothing keeping me interested in watching this show.

Episode 1,"Since the beginning of the project ""The High Republic,"" there has been a growing desire in me to actually see this world on the screen. It was announced fairly quickly that we were going to get that through ""The Acolyte,"" Leslye Headland's new Disney+ show. I was very excited, but also skeptical, given Lucasfilm's track record with their shows. However, this is a very interesting corner of the ""Star Wars"" universe, and as a big fan, it was my duty to give the show its due. And the premiere episode definitely put me right into the feeling I had when reading those novels and it felt good.Headland said that she wanted to take a different approach to the action, and was very inspired by martial arts films when thinking of the choreography. And this first episode definitely features some truly remarkable stunt work, with the opening sequence being a great example of this. It feels alive and real, although the stakes are a little gone in the midst of highly choreographed action. It's beautiful to look at nonetheless and it sets up the tone of the episode perfectly. The overall story of the episode is mostly dedicated to setting up the various characters, and some are certainly sticking out already. Lee Jung-jae's Jedi Master Sol is the embodiment of a Jedi and he is electric every time he comes on screen, commanding your attention and your respect. A few hints are given to the overall storyline of the season, and it's not tough to see where the episode works off of previously set ""Star Wars"" themes, which feels like a nice homage to what George Lucas originally wanted to do with the franchise. The technical aspects are quite good, with the production design certainly standing out; however, the show seems to be using the Volume a lot, and that has been a real issue for this latest ""Star Wars"" show as the usage has just become more obvious. There are also some dialogue in this episode that feels very prequel-esque, and while I think it's deliberate, it borders on being cringeworthy and that's something I hope I won't have to get used to.""Lost / Found"" is a solid start to this show, setting up the characters beautifully and giving us good hints as to what this story is. The action choreography is excellent and while the look of the show is very pleasing, there are some visual aspects that could use some work, especially all the Volume stuff.","beginning project High Republic grow desire actually world screen announce fairly quickly go Acolyte Leslye Headland new Disney+ excited skeptical give Lucasfilm track record show interesting corner Star Wars universe big fan duty premiere episode definitely right feeling read novel feel good Headland say want different approach action inspire martial art film think choreography episode definitely feature truly remarkable stunt work opening sequence great example feel alive real stake little go midst highly choreographed action beautiful look nonetheless set tone episode perfectly overall story episode dedicate set character certainly stick Lee Jung jae Jedi Master Sol embodiment Jedi electric time come screen command attention respect hint give overall storyline season tough episode work previously set Star Wars theme feel like nice homage George Lucas originally want franchise technical aspect good production design certainly stand volume lot real issue late Star Wars usage obvious dialogue episode feel prequel esque think deliberate border cringeworthy hope will ""lost Found solid start set character beautifully give good hint story action choreography excellent look pleasing visual aspect use work especially Volume stuff",POSITIVE,0.9994366765022278
Episode 1,"The beautiful thing about The Mandalorian and Andor was the discovery. ""Here's a character, watch what they do, and you'll figure out the rest as you go along."" They left us almost constantly in suspense, wondering what was going to happen next. What's this person's goal? Why are they doing this? What's their next move? The first episode of The Acolyte has decided to do away with all of that.Right off the bat there's text on the screen explaining exactly when in the Star Wars timeline we are, and the plot is immediately laid out. What follows are 40mins of unsurprising, wildly cliché events with dull, obvious characters that are trying so heavy-handedly to make you feel something they alienate the audience completely. Sorry writers, but giving me less than 5mins to wonder why someone dislikes fire before flat-out telling me is super boring.The episode's dull writing can't be saved by the mediocre acting, and it leaves me feeling disappointed that a project that could have been so promising and so interesting is off to such a soulless start.",beautiful thing Mandalorian Andor discovery character watch figure rest leave constantly suspense wonder go happen person goal episode Acolyte decide away right bat text screen explain exactly Star Wars timeline plot immediately lay follow 40mins unsurprising wildly cliché event dull obvious character try heavy handedly feel alienate audience completely sorry writer give 5mins wonder dislike fire flat tell super boring episode dull writing save mediocre acting leave feel disappoint project promising interesting soulless start,NEGATIVE,0.9990057349205017
Episode 1,I've seen a lot of people down voting this and I'm not sure why. Combat choreography is great. It really suprised me how much it flowed. I do think it weird when Mae challenge Jedi and says that kind of cringy dialogue but it didn't ruin it for me. The story so far is very interesting too. I never thought mystery and Star Wars would work so well together. The mystery surrounding the Sith is very interesting and especially his views. This show is also very stacked with amazing actors which I was very worried that the performance wouldn't be good enough. I hope this show stays as consistent and people give it a chance instead of instantly hating for no reason.,see lot people vote sure combat choreography great suprise flow think weird Mae challenge Jedi say kind cringy dialogue ruin story far interesting think mystery Star Wars work mystery surround Sith interesting especially view stacked amazing actor worried performance good hope stay consistent people chance instead instantly hate reason,POSITIVE,0.991630494594574
Episode 1,"As always with Star Wars you mostly get extreme comments that either describe it as one of the best or worst productions ever. In reality in my opinion it is neither. There are positives and negatives for me so far, but judging it all based on the first episode is way too early.As a long time fan of the original movies, the premise of The Acolyte is undeniably interesting. I like the setting, with its time period, world building and depiction of the Jedi order. I also think the writers have come up with a relatively interesting concept for a story so far.Unfortunately this opening episode relies far too much on exposition dialogue written in an incredibly obvious and jarring way, to the point it feels patronising in the moments where character backstory is addressed. Very little goes unexplained. There is even a sequence of dialogue that explains what we see in a previous scene.It is a bit early to say whether the characters work or not, so the jury is out for me, but nobody has stood out with any real charisma or a dominant presence so far.The martial art scenes and general action moments are well done if you are into that type of spectacle. It does feel very Matrix and like a variety of Kung Fu movies. Certain scenes also remind me very much of The Fugitive, but they are reasonably good tributes. Generally the visuals are high quality, as you would expect from a Star Wars project.It did make me want to see what happens next, but this might just be due to curiosity about another entry in the franchise.For me it's a 6.5/10, but I round upwards.",Star Wars extreme comment describe good bad production reality opinion positive negative far judge base episode way early long time fan original movie premise Acolyte undeniably interesting like setting time period world building depiction Jedi order think writer come relatively interesting concept story far unfortunately opening episode rely far exposition dialogue write incredibly obvious jarring way point feel patronise moment character backstory address little go unexplained sequence dialogue explain previous scene bit early character work jury stand real charisma dominant presence far martial art scene general action moment type spectacle feel Matrix like variety Kung Fu movie certain scene remind Fugitive reasonably good tribute generally visual high quality expect Star Wars project want happen curiosity entry franchise 6.5/10 round upwards,POSITIVE,0.9317522048950195
Episode 1,"Ep 1 attempts to set the stage for a new Star Wars adventure, but it feels more like a stumbling first step than a grand beginning. The narrative pace is sluggish, making it difficult to stay engaged. The characters, though diverse, come across as flat and unmemorable, lacking the depth one would expect from a Star Wars series. The visuals, while impressive, can't compensate for the underwhelming storyline and wooden dialogue. It's as if the creators were more focused on ticking boxes than delivering a truly compelling tale.

Those who liked The Mandalorian or Boba Fett will find little of that here, but they will discover new facets of Star Wars.

Episode 1,"Part one of ""The Acolyte"" got me with its grabber of a tease: having Carrie-Anne Moss guest starring as a Jedi warrior doing battle with Mae in surprising fashion (especially the dramatic payoff) was quite exciting, as her solemn presence and amazing physicality are hard to beat.

I've been a Star Wars fan for years, but let's say I've lost interest in almost everything they've done since the insult that was Episode 9.

There's a lot happening in little time and there are a couple inconsistencies here and there (could the Jedi at the beginning not sense Osha can use the force ?)The cinematography is your average Disney+ show but even worse making it look increasingly more like a CW show.

Episode 1,"By now it's common knowledge that negative review-bombing of Disney Star Wars shows is a tactic used by a minority of very angry fans. They openly encourage it on social media. Ignore the anger and watch The Acolyte for yourself. It's fun, suspenseful, and pretty much everything you want Star Wars to be. Master Sol, played by Lee Jung-Jae, already takes his place as one of the great Jedi in Star Wars lore. He is warm, kind, protective, devoted to the Order, and yet he doesn't follow along blindly. He thinks for himself. Major props to the actor for learning English for this role. Osha, played by Amanda Stenberg, is Sol's former padawan. When they reconnect, their old bond becomes evident. Jedi knight Yord, played by Charlie Barnett, is an obvious by-the-rulebook overachiever who tries really hard. He might sound unlikeable, but he's actually not. It's super interesting to see a series in the time of the High Republic, with the bustling, beautiful temple, and the younglings in their classes, and the Jedi at their peak. There's a dark mystery aspect to the series which is intriguing, and you'll come away wondering ""who"" and ""what,"" but speculation is part of the fun. So, don't allow people with an agenda, who attack and harass the show's cast, to turn you away from good entertainment. I know fans who were raised on the original trilogy and they're enjoying the show as much as newer / younger fans.

In a fight between force users why would a force user bother with hand to hand combat when you have a lightsaber, and the force to just grab someone and subdue them? Makes no sense at all.2) Twins that have grown up for years separately have the exact same braided hair, cut in the exact same fashion, and have the exact same body dimensions as each other. How is this possible? Kids go through many hairstyles in the course of a life, especially during their teenage, and post teenage years. One isn't fatter than the other, or more fit? Did they have the exact same diet, and workout routine, even though one is some dark force cult, and the other is a mechanic on space freighters?3) The droids have no verisimilitude to them, they look like plastic toys, or cheap made in China products. Believable looking droids has been a staple of Star Wars, these designs how the look, and function fall way short of the precedent set by the trilogy. They don't look real.4) Sedated guy in prison ship wakes up from whatever paralyzing affect the parasite on his face was doing to him, is instantly coherent and understanding of the situation, and bee lines to an escape pod to escape.5) One of the braid kids survives a crash landing space ship by merely wearing a seat belt, the seat, and seat belt she was using aren't even intact when we see that she survived the crash. She has no marks, scratches, or injuries from said crash.6) People on an ice planet wear short sleeves, and don't seem to notice the cold at all. Jedi knowingly go to an ice planet without even bothering to wear appropriate winter clothing. Also no frost mist comes out of anyone's mouth as they talk or breath, as would happen if the ice planet were actually cold.7) Operatives working with the Jedi pick up survivors that ejected from the prison ship prior to the crash, then bring them all the way back to Corescant to question them about the crash when they had to pick them up above the planet that the ship crashed on. What sense does that make? Why wouldn't you question, and investigate the crash while you were there?8) Also why would two Jedi, who have their own spacecraft leave the prime suspect accused of killing a force using Jedi in the hands of a robot security prison ship. If she was indeed the murderer, and had force abilities, why the hell wouldn't the Jedi transport her themselves. Why risk the chance of her using force powers to seize control of the prison ship and escape? So stupid.9) Also everything from the spaceships, to the locations, to the interiors, everything looks immaculate and fake. Nothing looks lived in, everything looks so clean that it looks like a set or some green screen created background. The show runner is obviously inept in that the worn look was one of the key things that made real Star Wars movies come alive, that these locations look like they could actually exist(Even the Andor show got this right). In this show, everything from the worlds, to the planet landscapes, to the ships everything looks like it's on a stage or a computer screen. Really breaks all immersion.10) Beyond those glaring insults to the audience's intelligence, there was the bad acting, bored actors, bad writing, bad dialogue, and a bad cliche ridden tired, and predictable story. The production value does not seem close to what was reportedly spent on this miserable excuse for a Star Wars product. I'm sure there were more bad to include that I missed, but I couldn't stomach watching it a second time. It's so bad that I couldn't even watch the second episode. This from a man who forced himself to endure every other Star Wars abomination created by Disney.Now for the good:
1) It was nice to see Carrie Anne Moss getting some of those Disney dollars without having to be in this long enough to hurt her career.In closing, this is where I draw the line. Star Wars is officially dead to me, I don't even care any longer. So that's something.There is so much awful in the Star Wars now, that it drowns out, and obscures the good that was made in the 70s and 80s. I guess Disney got it's wish, it's time to let the past die, and this series killed it because I guess they felt they had to.","thing hate Acolyte

Episode 1,"I've done episode reviews for ""Star Wars"" shows before, notably on ""Book of Boba Fett"" so perhaps I don't have the best track record with it - but, I have free time so I might as well do it again with ""The Acolyte"" which I started last night. As with quite a few first episodes of shows, this has too much to establish to really form much of an opinion about it.A century before Republics would shift to Empires, Osha (Amandla Stenberg) is arrested for the murder of a Jedi Master. She protests her innocence to the crime but is identified by a witness and set for transport to Coruscant. The transport vessel is taken over by the other convicts and crashes on an ice planet. Earlier in her life Osha was a trainee at the Jedi academy and her former master Sol (Lee Jung-Jae) leads a team to recover her. At the crash site, Osha sees a vision of her twin sister Mae, long thought dead and apparently the true perpetrator of the crime.I'll keep this review a spoiler free as I can, but perhaps the most notable thing that the show does is kill off someone who you might have considered one of its key characters, from the advertising if nothing else, in the opening scene. Perhaps flashbacks will give us another opportunity to see them, there is certainly some story to be mined in how Osha left the academy, if not exactly why, but still it's a surprising twist. Her relationship with the Jedis pursuing her is interesting, Sol clearly wants to save and clear her; Yord, played by Charlie Barnett from Headland's hit series ""Russian Doll"" warily draws his sabre and Jecki - played by an unrecognisable Dafne Keen in prosthetics curiously watches on.Interesting to see the usage of Neimoidian's in the series and the Jedi temple looks like it has in previous incarnations. No other links to the preexisting Star Wars story, which I'd suggest is probably the right way to go.As I said, hard to really judge the episode as it's got so many characters to introduce as well as the inciting incident, but I'd describe the episode as being fine. I'm not particularly blown away, but neither am I considering not watching the next one.",episode review Star Wars show notably Book Boba Fett good track record free time Acolyte start night episode show establish form opinion century republic shift Empires Osha Amandla Stenberg arrest murder Jedi Master protest innocence crime identify witness set transport Coruscant transport vessel take convict crash ice planet early life Osha trainee Jedi academy master Sol Lee Jung Jae lead team recover crash site Osha see vision twin sister Mae long think dead apparently true perpetrator crime I'll review spoiler free notable thing kill consider key character advertising opening scene flashback opportunity certainly story mine Osha leave academy exactly surprising twist relationship Jedis pursue interesting Sol clearly want save clear Yord play Charlie Barnett Headland hit series russian Doll warily draw sabre Jecki play unrecognisable Dafne Keen prosthetic curiously watch interesting usage Neimoidian series Jedi temple look like previous incarnation link preexisting Star Wars story suggest probably right way say hard judge episode get character introduce inciting incident describe episode fine particularly blow away consider watch,POSITIVE,0.977047324180603
Episode 2,"I wanted more than anything to enjoy this show. A few days before release, I had heard it was being compared to Andor and I breathed a sigh of relief. I also knew that, based on the last few years of Star Wars content, I should take it with a grain of salt. I'm very glad I did that.This show is not what I expected, and that isn't what frustrates me... what frustrates me is that its worse than the idea that I had. I understand that may be partially my fault, but they set up a clear vision in the trailers, then just didn't do that? Maybe I'm in the minority, but it felt like false advertising. This may have been done to prevent spoilers, but that doesn't change the fact that what the trailers showed seemed so much better than what we got. Now to talk about the spoilers.1. To me, the trailers made it seem like we would be following a Sith acolyte and the Jedi would be less of a focus. Instead, the acolyte has a twin sister who is actually the main character and also working with the Jedi. That's what I call a bad twist. I would have been far more interested in having a show that follows a Sith, which is exactly what people got excited for, and yet they pulled the rug from beneath us and gave more of the same. And to reveal the twist in the first episode is wild. Not in a good way.2. I want to love the main character. I really really do. The problem is that they've made her as dumb as your typical B-horror movie character. In the first episode, she needs to put out a fire on the exterior of the ship and instead has a flashback and stares at the fire for a few seconds while right in front of it. Okay, sure, PTSD, but it was very poorly written. Then in the second episode, she's walking with a few Jedi who recently arrested her and are still cautious. And she decides to... wait, she BREAKS OFF FROM THE GROUP TO EXPLORE?! This isn't a video game! It doesn't make sense! She then comes across a body, landing herself in trouble, and the consequences are immediately erased. I just... I just can't. This is such bad writing.Now for what I like.1. The settings, outfits, and aliens are cool, I guess, but it isn't the same quality of some of the recent shows and movies. In places, it feels bland and low budget. But if you look past that, it does have an interesting vibe with the Jedi being space cops. Also, it's cool to see a new Star Wars era on screen. We need much more of that.2. The actors were great. I really mean that. While I may not like a few of the characters, it's absolutely no fault of the actors. They did their job, and wonderfully so. The two main characters were the clear standouts, being Amanda Stenberg and Lee Jung-jae. I can't wait to see more of them... but mainly just because they're great at their job.In conclusion, I really hope this show gets better. Star Wars deserves to have care and love put back into it, and it feels like we don't get that very often anymore. I just want to be able to fall into the world rather than getting angry because the twists suck and the characters are dumb. That being said, no one who worked on the show, or Star Wars in general, deserves harassment or review bombing. They worked damn hard, and while it isn't my cup of tea, it clearly was theirs. I just hope our visions for the future of this franchise will eventually align again.",want enjoy day release hear compare Andor breathe sigh relief know base year Star Wars content grain salt glad expect frustrate frustrate bad idea understand partially fault set clear vision trailer maybe minority feel like false advertising prevent spoiler change fact trailer show well get talk spoilers.1 trailer like follow Sith acolyte Jedi focus instead acolyte twin sister actually main character work Jedi bad twist far interested have follow Sith exactly people get excite pull rug beneath give reveal twist episode wild good way.2 want love main character problem dumb typical B horror movie character episode need fire exterior ship instead flashback stare fire second right okay sure PTSD poorly write second episode walk Jedi recently arrest cautious decide wait breaks GROUP explore video game sense come body land trouble consequence immediately erase bad writing like.1 setting outfit alien cool guess quality recent show movie place feel bland low budget look past interesting vibe Jedi space cop cool new Star Wars era screen need that.2 actor great mean like character absolutely fault actor job wonderfully main character clear standout Amanda Stenberg Lee Jung jae wait mainly great job conclusion hope get well Star Wars deserve care love feel like anymore want able fall world get angry twist suck character dumb say work Star Wars general deserve harassment review bombing work damn hard cup tea clearly theirs hope vision future franchise eventually align,NEGATIVE,0.9870676398277283
Episode 2,"The first crime that unfortunately ripples through every part of the show is how badly written the scripts are. It is worse than a scooby doo murder mystery. It feels like they were told to make every character have the IQs of a crayon vs reading the situation and ""thinking"" about what came to pass. I don't think I will finish this series and it would be the first star wars media I've bailed on.The Jedi Master ranking was given out like it was a cone from an ice cream truck. Outside of Master Sol, the other Masters are not only just racing to conclusions about almost everything (not just the murders), they don't use the Force to search their feelings/the future, just react and give into fear/hasty decision making. These are supposed to be beings of immense respect & power. You just don't feel that with the way these characters are written.The direction is also not great. The younger cast needed some notes for sure on over acting some of the scenes and should've done more takes. You don't need to go Kubrick on them, but they feel like they were told ""that's great, that's great, moving on"" vs ""let's do another one, change xyz and tone down emphasis"" (I bet it was hard as the writing really is first draft with spelling mistakes and spilled coffee on script levels of bad). Director's can reshape the written page and for how flat the writing is for both episodes, Leslie had the opportunity to reshape it on set and chose not to. Either can't see the problems because too many yes people around, or chose to ignore them which in a lot of ways is worse and will be worse for the development of the show moving forward.So far, I cannot see how this will gain an audience, or a second season unless it changes gears in episode 3-4. I wanted to like it, the concept for the show was interesting, they just REALLY didn't do their homework and don't seem to care how much they ignored/got wrong/didn't punch up.",crime unfortunately ripple badly write script bad scooby doo murder mystery feel like tell character iq crayon vs read situation think come pass think finish series star war medium bail Jedi Master ranking give like cone ice cream truck outside Master Sol Masters race conclusion murder use Force search feeling future react fear hasty decision making suppose being immense respect power feel way character write direction great young cast need note sure act scene take need Kubrick feel like tell great great move vs let change xyz tone emphasis bet hard writing draft spelling mistake spill coffee script level bad Director reshape write page flat writing episode Leslie opportunity reshape set choose problem yes people choose ignore lot way bad bad development move forward far gain audience second season change gear episode 3 4 want like concept interesting homework care ignore get wrong didn't punch,NEGATIVE,0.9986957907676697
Episode 2,"How can anyone watch this show without rolling their eyes?I need the writers to explain how there is any logic in trusting a suspected murderer just because one of the Jedi says he knew her from before when she was nice to him, and then instantly concluding that the real culprit must be her presumed-dead twin sister.Sure, let's imagine, for the sake of the plot, that they have to trust her and take her with them to find the real culprit. At least hold her in a cell or don't let her freely roam the ship with the possibility of fleeing or hurting someone else.And don't get me started on how they choose to fully trust her and give her a gun after she was found next to a poisoned body. They explain this by saying she couldn't have done it because the hero Jedi was following her before eventually losing track of her.. like what, wait.. he lost track of her so she couldn't have done it?

Episode 2,"At this point, we have become so used to ""Star Wars"" being set in a specific place in time, and to see something that doesn't feel like it's a part of the Skywalker Saga can be a bit strange at times. There are moments where I have to remind myself that this is not set during the prequels, but actually an entirely different chapter of this universe. And it feels great to be watching something where I don't have any idea about its final direction. This episode continues in the veins of the previous one, both in terms of its strengths and its few shortcomings.A lot of the issues I had with the first episode are repeated here, but the writing for this is considerably more of a mixed bag. The additions to the mystery of what went down on Osha and Mae's home planet and why Mae bears a grudge against the Jedi are all very fascinating and fulfills the promise of this feeling like a detective show in a way. It also continues to bring in a slew of interesting characters, but the issue is that the episode's don't dedicate nearly enough time for any investment in these new characters. Lee Jung-jae's Sol continues to be the highlight of the show, but a lot of supporting characters seem to be exclusively a personality and not a lot more. It's not that they are bad characters, there's just not enough in there for me to actually care for them, so a few big events of this episode left me pretty emotionless. However, the action sequences are still proving to be among some of the franchise's very best, and the idea of Jedi fighting without using their lightsaber and adapting more a martial arts style of combat is so visually pleasing to watch and it makes for some incredibly fun and badass fight scenes. The episode also features a more pleasing visual look as a lot of the visual effects are better and the Volume is less aggressively used in this episode, although some of the production design does feel reminiscent of things that we've seen in the universe before.""Revenge / Justice"" makes for another solid entry as it continues to lay the groundwork for the show, but the writing is an overall mixed bag. The fight choreography is still a highlight of the show, and the visual effects are better utilized in this episode, making the world feel more vibrant and lived-in.","point Star Wars set specific place time feel like Skywalker Saga bit strange time moment remind set prequel actually entirely different chapter universe feel great watch idea final direction episode continue vein previous term strength shortcoming lot issue episode repeat writing considerably mixed bag addition mystery go Osha Mae home planet Mae bear grudge Jedi fascinating fulfill promise feeling like detective way continue bring slew interesting character issue episode dedicate nearly time investment new character Lee Jung jae Sol continue highlight lot support character exclusively personality lot bad character actually care big event episode leave pretty emotionless action sequence prove franchise good idea Jedi fight lightsaber adapt martial art style combat visually pleasing watch make incredibly fun badass fight scene episode feature pleasing visual look lot visual effect well volume aggressively episode production design feel reminiscent thing see universe ""Revenge Justice make solid entry continue lay groundwork writing overall mixed bag fight choreography highlight visual effect well utilize episode make world feel vibrant live",POSITIVE,0.9640389680862427

Episode 2,"There is so much a show that is set before the events of the majority of Star Wars depicted in the shows and movies so far can show: so many possible stories to tell. Since this series focuses more on an older Jedi order, it could dive deeper into the lore of the force (what it can do outside of what we have seen in the main canon so far).I am a little disappointed that they revealed Osha to have a twin (or the short lived mystery whether Osha was in fact the Jedi killer) way too soon. I kept thinking about two main theories in the beginning: 1. Some split personality thing (having the dark side take over Osha and commit these acts of revenge because she was somehow betrayed or let down by the Jedi) 2. A twin sister. However, I didn't think the twin would be the answer because it is too on the nose and IT IS NEVER TWINS!!But alas.The first option would have been a great source of conflict: Osha struggling between wanting revenge for the betrayal (that would have slowly been revealed throughout the story) and knowing that this might have been a necessary betrayal in the name of the greater good of the Jedi or whatever. We would have seen the struggle between the light and the dark side reflected in the actions of one person: each side not knowing the other exists.But we got the twin thing. Which is fine. I guess. But nothing that special or daring.I didn't mind the first two episodes too much. I enjoyed them. They were fine. Just fine. And that is sort of disappointing. By not being bound by the main Star Wars Canon we know so far, they could've created something new entirely, but instead, they opted for something generic and an overall quite grounded storyline (which was fine for Andor but shouldn't be for the mysticism of the Jedi).I hope I am wrong with this initial assessment and they find a way to make something memorable as the season progresses.",set event majority Star Wars depict show movie far possible story tell series focus old Jedi order dive deeply lore force outside see main canon far).i little disappointed reveal Osha twin short live mystery Osha fact Jedi killer way soon keep think main theory beginning 1 split personality thing have dark Osha commit act revenge betray let Jedi 2 twin sister think twin answer nose TWINS!!But ala option great source conflict Osha struggle want revenge betrayal slowly reveal story know necessary betrayal great good Jedi see struggle light dark reflect action person know exist get twin thing fine guess special daring mind episode enjoy fine fine sort disappointing bind main Star Wars Canon know far create new entirely instead opt generic overall ground storyline fine Andor mysticism Jedi).I hope wrong initial assessment find way memorable season progress,NEGATIVE,0.9793297648429871

The acting and script level is on par with Nickelodeon and Disney teen shows.The plot is very straight forward backed by a script that will state exactly what will happen next.The fight scenes are very well filmed and coordinated. The feel of it reminded me of watching Kung Fu tv shows as a kid.The cast is more diverse than ever before. So new audiences will be able to find their own heroes in the Star Wars universe.Sets and props are stunning. Really this is the part that shines in the show. But I don't think this part has ever been anything but excellent in SW.This show clearly emphasizes pushing boundaries in a Star Trek like scenes, casting and dialog at times the show seemed like Star Trek entirely but with Star Wars sets. This aspect may make it or break it for you. I know this is a contentious topic.

So dumb how the Bad Twin is able to kill Jedi. This is the second Jedi-are-chumps death. Sensing a trend.None of these character dynamics work with what's been established by the narrative.

Episode 2,"My title is lifted from one of many cliched lines that plauges this episode.In this episode, our protagonists are hot on the trail of Mae, the evil twin sister of our briefly accused heroine Osha (Which makes me think of ""Occupational Safety and Health Administration"" every time I hear it). Another jedi has been murdered, this time on some other planet with yet another city/market. The episode plays out briefly like a cop procedural show with our Jedi from Coruscant investigating, talking to locals and even throwing a wire on a character to get a suspect's confession. I found this aspect kind of interesting within the SW universe. But it's very short-lived and we're soon moved onto yet another immaculately (and frankly uninspired) choregraphed fight, more exposition and ANOTHER(!) abrupt ending. What is up with this? ARe these type of endings going to be a common thread for this series? It didn't work again. This episode did not need to end at the scene it did--introducing a new character on a new location. By the time it starts and gets us asking questions, we are soon wiping to the credits. If this is what the creators thought would be a ""cliffhanger ending"", this ain't it.One thing I'm noticing is a tendency for moments and scenes to not breathe enough. It feels like characters are often giving information at each other and not actually addressing the person/people they're talking to. Everything lacks any complex emotion except for what's required--Example: Master Jedi Sol (played by Lee Jung-Jae) who often broods and looks off into space. Often times, something will be said, and it feels like everybody is ignoring each other and just moving on. As soon the creators feel satisfied that what needs to be said is conveyed, we're whisked onto the next idea.In a similar example that really fell flat for me: after a sting operation on a poison dealer (that assisted in killing the aforementioned jedi in this episode), he's cornered by our protagonists and then says a line clearly attempted at humor ""Please don't Jedi mind erase me"" (I paraphrased it). But this very out of the blue comment, which potentially could've worked, amounts to nothing. Nobody acknowledges it. Not a cutaway to a Osha, who is not a fully trained Jedi, who I think would've been given some humanity if she reacted by being confused by this like we, the audience, are. So I'm left asking ""What does this mean?"" It just stood out from everything utilitarian that we hear throughout these episodes. Is it just world-building by the way of mention? Also, at the top of the ""recorded confession"" scene with Osha, there were like 5 ""hello""s and ""hi""s exchanged with the poison dealer which made me laugh out loud but definitely felt unintentional with the tone of this show.The audience needs something to hold onto. There's a way to be more engaging to the audience in the execution of this that doesn't require an extra budget. Short cutaways of characters processing and reacting more than flat to information, would be nice. Or let's go back to the actual line in the title of my review--How many freaking times have you heard a character caught in a moment that could frame them say ""I know what this looks like, but I can explain!"" ? Writer: These lines can be remixed to be more interesting.Another thing that I feel bears highlighting is our actors. It seems they don't quite gel with their characters and it's across the board, as well. I don't know if there was more shot and we're seeing performances distilled; or if it's the already apparent uninspired writing, a rushed production, bad direction, lack of rehearsals or maybe it's a combination of all these things-- but I'm not going to blame the casting itself. I think all of these actors are wonderful and have been in some very good projects. It leads me to think that none of our cast were given anything to do. Charlie Barnett, for example, was such an interesting presence in ""Russian Doll"" which I think takes a certain skill to successfully walk that performance. But here he's so underutilized. Also, while I think Lee Jung-Jae is a very good actor, has good presence and a good gruff voice suitable for a jedi master. But with Sol, we have yet typical jedi master direction that has historically favored men. Why wasn't Carrie Anne-Moss swapped with Lee as the series lead Jedi? It would've changed the entire dynamic of the series and brought a fresh take. It is truly a missed opportunity. Finally, I know I mentioned this in my episode 1 review, but I am completely irked by the fact that Daphne Keen and Rebecca Henderson had to endure heavy alien make-up only to possess characters that were not given an accent, a different language or even a voice-change effect. Give us something to take us out of actors being themselves in alien makeup which looks like cosplay.It's funny because in the woefully abrupt final scene of this episode, we have two characters speaking to each other in lively Hutteese which was a standout moment for me. I almost felt a rise in that I wasn't being given uninspired writing in the English language. It even made me think for a moment that maybe they should've garbled the English for everybody and subtitled the entire show.Alright look, making movies or television is tough. It's a Frankenstein affair in which you shoot out of sequence and have to keep the consistency to strongly piece it all together. I read that this show took 4 years to make. I'm not sure if that's a telling reason to why we're seeing some weird decisions with performances, dialogue and pacing. I'm just not sure what went wrong here but with Leslye Headland's name attached, I hoped for a series that would do something different and swing for the fences. But clearly something went wrong here.I'd much rather have a group of artists try to do something unique and fail, than see the same formula repeated over and over which is still a failure, artistically.","title lift cliched line plauge episode episode protagonist hot trail Mae evil twin sister briefly accuse heroine Osha make think Occupational Safety Health Administration time hear jedi murder time planet city market episode play briefly like cop procedural Jedi Coruscant investigate talk local throw wire character suspect confession find aspect kind interesting SW universe short live soon move immaculately frankly uninspired choregraphe fight exposition abrupt end type ending go common thread series work episode need end scene introduce new character new location time start get ask question soon wipe credit creator think cliffhanger ending be thing notice tendency moment scene breathe feel like character give information actually address person people talk lack complex emotion require example Master Jedi Sol play Lee Jung Jae brood look space time say feel like everybody ignore move soon creator feel satisfied need say convey whisk idea similar example fall flat sting operation poison dealer assist kill aforementioned jedi episode corner protagonist say line clearly attempt humor Jedi mind erase paraphrase blue comment potentially work amount acknowledge cutaway Osha fully train Jedi think give humanity react confuse like audience leave ask mean stand utilitarian hear episode world building way mention record confession scene Osha like 5 hello""s hi""s exchange poison dealer laugh loud definitely feel unintentional tone audience need hold way engaging audience execution require extra budget short cutaway character process react flat information nice let actual line title review freaking time hear character catch moment frame know look like explain writer line remixe interesting thing feel bear highlight actor gel character board know shot see performance distil apparent uninspired writing rush production bad direction lack rehearsal maybe combination things-- go blame casting think actor wonderful good project lead think cast give Charlie Barnett example interesting presence russian Doll think take certain skill successfully walk performance underutilized think Lee Jung Jae good actor good presence good gruff voice suitable jedi master Sol typical jedi master direction historically favor man Carrie Anne Moss swap Lee series lead Jedi change entire dynamic series bring fresh truly miss opportunity finally know mention episode 1 review completely irk fact Daphne Keen Rebecca Henderson endure heavy alien possess character give accent different language voice change effect actor alien makeup look like cosplay funny woefully abrupt final scene episode character speak lively Hutteese standout moment feel rise give uninspired writing english language think moment maybe garble English everybody subtitle entire alright look make movie television tough Frankenstein affair shoot sequence consistency strongly piece read take 4 year sure tell reason see weird decision performance dialogue pacing sure go wrong Leslye Headland attach hope series different swing fence clearly go wrong I'd group artist try unique fail formula repeat failure artistically",NEGATIVE,0.9919599890708923

The child acting was rough and that wasn't helped by the poor dialogue and awkward interactions with the other characters.The entire witch plot felt cheesy and slightly out of place.However, underneath it all, there is a true Star Wars story that wants to show itself.The witch's might be a bit different from what we've seen in star wars in the past, but they follow canon. The witches of dathomir can't be the only ones who draw on the force differently from the Jedi. It would make sense that the Jedi, even 100 years before the fall of the republic, would be very protective of the way the force is used, and who can use it.The mystery of how the twins were created is also intriguing because it mirrors that of the ""chosen one"" but how the girls were made would be considered an abomination to the Jedi.So that leaves me hoping for the story to unfold in a particular way. If I'm correct, Mae did not light the fire, it was the Jedi. They were sent to destroy the witches, but lied to Osha. The Jedi justify their actions as for the good of the republic.This type of mindset is already evident in the prequels. I can believe that has existed far longer then that.This show has a lot of shortcomings.

Episode 3,".....there is plenty of space for things not shown in previous Star Wars stories. A coven of force-sensitive women isn't outside the realm of possibility. And they might have been prosecuted because of their powers. There are several planets at least in the old Star Wars extended universe which were hostile to force users in general or Jedi in particular.Moreover, this coven's interpretation of the Force as a ""thread"" might be different from what we have heard in Star Wars but it might just be a subjective description of what could be the same thing. Throughout our history there were several ways of describing something like gravity. Newton decribed it as a force, Faraday and Maxwell decribed it as a field of force extending outward at the speed of light and Einstein thought of it as a fundamental property of matter bending space and time around it. All we know is that if you drop a stone then it will fall to the ground. Considering that these witches only use the powers of ""Force push and Force pull"" which we have seen countless times in Star Wars, I can't say that their understanding of the Force breaks the ""in universe"" rules of Star Wars.As to the ""immaculate conception"" of the twins we have too little information from this episode alone to make an assessment if it ""breaks Star Wars"". Something similar happened in Star Wars only once with Anakin Skywalker. That was a major event caused by ""The Will of the Force"". The head of the coven described it as a ""miracle"". It doesn't look like it's a convenient work-around for this coven to procreate without males. However, since such an event would require a ""major disturbance in the Force"" and not ""It just happens because the plot demanded it!"", the writers certainly owe us an explanation better than ""I created them."".As to the Jedi. They execute their right to test children for their Force potential. I see no indicators that they would simply remove children from their families against their will by force. The witches fear that they will have to leave if they pass the Jedis' test but we simply don't know the protocol here. There is a ""cultural conflict"" with the coven and we just don't know how the Jedi would resolve this conflict if push came to shove.So much for Star Wars ""theory"", but does this episode work as entertainment? Well, it certainly is a slow burn. The relationship of the sisters isn't very riveting. It is abundantly clear that both are still very immature and not ready to ""ascend"" to anything. What makes it even worse is that they're played by child actors who arent very good at acting. The rest of the cast are uneven in their acting. The performance of Mother Aniseya is overly dramatic which subtracts from the gravitas she should have as a leader. Many other roles are either hyper-emotionals or wooden stoics. There certainly isn't much to connect to as a viewer. It says a lot when the Wookie Jedi is the most likable character (and if you're a cynic then you could say he has the best dialogue). The setting and the sets are nice, though. However, there were some strange editing choices of cutting away from a grandiose CGI scene to parts obviously shot on sound stages. Moreover, my pesky brain had some problems with dimensions and internal ""world logic"". How does a huge reactor room fit into a slim mountain? Where do all these witches get their food?Finally, the way one of the twins ""resolves"" her inner conflict leading to a catastrophe only shows how poorly prepared and trained she was by her coven to deal with her potential. Basically, she proves the Jedi right. She needs additional training by experts lest she turns to the Dark Side.All things considered, this episode isn't a ""world breaker"" but it certainly isn't a highlight of entertainment. It is a long flashback filler episode which seems to set up character motivations later in the season. Things like that have been done more efficiently.All in all this episode is just ""mid"". I hope the writers will eventually get to ""the good stuff"".

Episode 3,"For me this episode follows in the same vein as the opening two. It expands on a reasonably interesting mystery with a concept of how the Jedi recruit Younglings. Children living away from their families as part of the Jedi Order is not addressed in the prequel trilogy, so for me it is a worthwhile subject.I think the existence of other cultures centred around the phenomenon of the force, albeit with a differing perspective to the Jedi is also an interesting idea. It works for world building in the Star Wars universe and developing stories outside of Jedi/Sith perception of the force that we already know from the movies.As for how the story is told and the portrayal of the central characters I think this is where The Acolyte slightly falls down. This episode involves a flashback, and the filmmakers do little to visually distinguish between Mae and Osha, which makes certain scenes confusing. Plus the reaction of one twin to a decision made by the other for me feels contrived to bring about dramatic events and spectacle. Much of the dialogue is quite simplistic (e.g. ""Both of them; her sister too"") and makes certain scenes feel drawn out in my opinion.Arguably there did not need to be an entire episode dedicated to giving us this backstory this early, especially as it alludes to things referenced in exposition dialogue provided in the previous episodes. If so why mention those aspects previously when it could have been left a total mystery and just shown here or preferably later? That being said I think the tension created by a scene that involves a confrontation between two groups of people works fairly well. Plus you do want to find out what happened in moments that were not shown. I think my patience will wear thin if it takes several more episodes to do so.I think most performances are okay given the material the actors have to work with. However, there is a lot of the episode carried by the young actresses who play the central characters. I never criticise children on screen as I admire anyone so young to be doing something with such confidence, but do not think the material nor direction gets the best out of them. The twins should not feel they failed in any way, as it is a big ask and the responsibility of the writer and director to use their talents better.The general cinematography, editing and art design is strong as you would expect from a Star Wars production.Again many comments on IMDB are exaggerated extremes (as always with SW) saying it's either the best show ever or comparable to something you wipe off the bottom of your shoe. In reality it's neither. Never trust the opinion of one-time reviewers (press the menu button (3 dots) to the right of the up/down vote button and select ""see all reviews by"" and you can find out) and always be suspicious of those who do not qualify statements (positive or negative) with actual reasons or specific aspects of the film/show.",episode follow vein opening expand reasonably interesting mystery concept Jedi recruit youngling child live away family Jedi Order address prequel trilogy worthwhile subject think existence culture centre phenomenon force albeit differ perspective Jedi interesting idea work world building Star Wars universe develop story outside Jedi Sith perception force know movie story tell portrayal central character think Acolyte slightly fall episode involve flashback filmmaker little visually distinguish Mae Osha make certain scene confusing plus reaction twin decision feels contrive bring dramatic event spectacle dialogue simplistic e.g. sister make certain scene feel draw opinion arguably need entire episode dedicate give backstory early especially allude thing reference exposition dialogue provide previous episode mention aspect previously leave total mystery show preferably later say think tension create scene involve confrontation group people work fairly plus want find happen moment show think patience wear thin take episode think performance okay give material actor work lot episode carry young actress play central character criticise child screen admire young confidence think material direction get good twin feel fail way big ask responsibility writer director use talent well general cinematography editing art design strong expect Star Wars production comment IMDB exaggerated extreme SW say good comparable wipe shoe reality trust opinion time reviewer press menu button 3 dot right vote button select review find suspicious qualify statement positive negative actual reason specific aspect film,POSITIVE,0.9870274662971497

Episode 4,"The latest episode of The Acolyte fails to improve the series in any substantial way. The issues that have plagued the show from the beginning persist, leaving fans like me disillusioned and disappointed.The dialogue continues to be a significant weak point. Characters exchange lines that feel forced and unnatural, lacking the wit and charm that has defined the best of Star Wars dialogue. Conversations often devolve into exposition dumps, with characters stating the obvious or delivering cringe-worthy attempts at humor. This stilted dialogue detracts from the overall immersion and makes it difficult to connect with the characters on any meaningful level.The special effects, which should be a cornerstone of any Star Wars production, are underwhelming. Despite the presumably large budget, the CGI and practical effects look cheap and unconvincing. Spaceships lack the gritty realism of the original trilogy, and action sequences feel poorly choreographed and executed. The reliance on subpar effects undermines the epic scope that Star Wars is known for, making the galaxy far, far away feel much closer and less fantastical.The storyline heavily leans on nostalgia and cliffhangers rather than crafting a compelling narrative. Instead of building an original and engaging plot, the showrunners seem content to recycle familiar tropes and imagery from the Star Wars saga. This over-reliance on nostalgia does a disservice to the story, which feels more like a greatest hits compilation than a fresh addition to the canon. Furthermore, the cliffhangers are predictable and fail to generate genuine suspense, often feeling like cheap tricks to keep viewers hooked.The mysterious Sith wannabe, who is clearly Qimir, is another glaring misstep. The character's helmet, intended to evoke fear and intrigue, instead comes off as a lazy imitation of Kylo Ren's iconic design. The lack of originality in appearance is disappointing, and the helmet looks more like a Halloween costume than a menacing artifact of the dark side. This design failure further emphasizes the show's struggle to carve out its own identity within the Star Wars universe.In essence, The Acolyte does not feel like Star Wars. It comes across as a carbon copy of something that wants to be part of this beloved franchise but falls short in every aspect. The attempt to capitalize on the Star Wars name while failing to capture its spirit is evident. True fans, who understand what makes Star Wars special, will see through this facade and recognize the show for what it is: a subpar attempt at storytelling that lacks the heart, soul, and quality of the original films.The Acolyte remains a disappointing addition to the Star Wars universe. With bad dialogue, poor effects, a derivative storyline, and uninspired character design, the show fails to honor the legacy of the franchise. Instead of delivering an exciting new chapter in the Star Wars saga, it offers a hollow imitation that fails to resonate with fans. It's clear that slapping the Star Wars name on a product isn't enough to guarantee its success; the true magic of the franchise lies in its ability to tell compelling stories with memorable characters, something The Acolyte unfortunately does not achieve.",late episode Acolyte fail improve series substantial way issue plague beginning persist leave fan like disillusion disappoint dialogue continue significant weak point character exchange line feel force unnatural lack wit charm define good Star Wars dialogue conversation devolve exposition dump character state obvious deliver cringe worthy attempt humor stilte dialogue detract overall immersion make difficult connect character meaningful level special effect cornerstone Star Wars production underwhelme despite presumably large budget CGI practical effect look cheap unconvincing spaceship lack gritty realism original trilogy action sequence feel poorly choreograph execute reliance subpar effect undermine epic scope Star Wars know make galaxy far far away feel close fantastical storyline heavily lean nostalgia cliffhanger craft compelling narrative instead build original engaging plot showrunner content recycle familiar trope imagery Star Wars saga reliance nostalgia disservice story feel like great hit compilation fresh addition canon furthermore cliffhanger predictable fail generate genuine suspense feel like cheap trick viewer hook mysterious Sith wannabe clearly Qimir glare misstep character helmet intend evoke fear intrigue instead come lazy imitation Kylo Ren iconic design lack originality appearance disappointing helmet look like Halloween costume menacing artifact dark design failure emphasize struggle carve identity Star Wars universe essence Acolyte feel like Star Wars come carbon copy want beloved franchise fall short aspect attempt capitalize Star Wars fail capture spirit evident true fan understand make Star Wars special facade recognize subpar attempt storytelle lack heart soul quality original film Acolyte remain disappointing addition Star Wars universe bad dialogue poor effect derivative storyline uninspired character design fail honor legacy franchise instead deliver exciting new chapter Star Wars saga offer hollow imitation fail resonate fan clear slap Star Wars product guarantee success true magic franchise lie ability tell compelling story memorable character Acolyte unfortunately achieve,NEGATIVE,0.9985430240631104

This show currently is a bit weak but it has got high potential in regards to the sith as long as they don't break canon any further. One thing i disliked is killing off the wookie jedi offscreen as there was so much advertising regarding it but we didn't even see a fight between them.

Episode 4,"Episode 4 of Disney's The Acolyte series is an unexpected filler, especially baffling considering the series only has eight episodes, each lasting a mere 35-50 minutes. One would think that with such a limited runtime, every moment would be packed with meaningful content, but episode 4 proves otherwise.The bulk of the episode is spent meandering through a forest, devoid of engaging dialogue or significant plot development. The characters' journey through the woods feels aimless, with long stretches of silence that fail to build tension or advance the storyline in any meaningful way.The entire purpose of the episode seems to be to set up the final scene, which introduces the antagonist displaying their powers. However, this brief moment hardly justifies the 30 minutes of uneventful wandering that precedes it.Overall, episode 4's lackluster script and absence of compelling content make it a disappointing midpoint for The Acolyte.

Episode 4,"The Acolyte's latest episode felt like obvious filler. Despite being very short, it felt extremely slow and boring. There were too many scenes of ships taking off and landing, wasting irrelevant time that could have been better spent on advancing the plot or developing the characters. The dialogue was abundant yet contributed nothing meaningful to the story, making it feel like the writers were simply trying to fill the runtime. The episode was riddled with problems related to distance and travel times, which made the pacing feel inconsistent and disjointed.Once again, a character's sudden change of heart came out of nowhere, feeling rushed and nonsensical. This change lacked proper buildup and context, making it hard to believe and undermining the character's development. The ending was entirely predictable, failing to deliver any real surprises or emotional impact. After all the filler, there was just one interesting minute before the episode ended, leaving viewers feeling unsatisfied and disappointed.Overall, this episode did little to advance the overarching narrative and felt like a missed opportunity.

If you knew anything about how action movies are made these days, you'd know that all action is subcontracted through specialists. So Leslie Headland has no say in the action choreography.

And because this whole episode was basically light saber and hand to hand fighting, it basically meant he directed the whole thing.

When the characters talk to each other you quickly remember that the writing is not great.The story is very predictable, Osha mentions her mother being able to control minds, which is supposed to be a red herring, but is so obvious that you know it's not her. That leaves the only other obvious character to be a so called ""sith lord."" It's just so cliche at this point that it is boring. My hope is that he is revealed to be the apprentice of Darth Tenebrous or Plagus, or else it will be proof that the writer have no respect for the fans or the story.Then there is the ""parent trap"" twist at the end.

The stand off between Master Sol and the 'Sith' was very nicely done and I think if it ended literally any other way than it did (the Sith being carried away by bugs) it would have been phenomenal. The whole segment between Osha and her sister in the later half of the episode just doesn't feel natural because she's playing 2 onscreen characters but not changing up her acting or tone between the 2 and it feels very flat.

The dialogue has been consistently bland and flat throughout these five episodes, and the monologues in this specific episode were just uninteresting. Like he was trying to cook, but I personally did not think he cooked. I would also say that 90% of Osha's dialogue within the last two episodes consisted of her and someone else walking through the woods, them stopping in their tracks, and then her just spewing out a bunch of nonsense.I also have not been a fan of the editing of this series, specifically with the transitions from scene-to-scene and with the music. I don't know why it just feels off every time there's a switch in scenes (don't know if anyone else feels the same way).

The Sith easily defeats them. His helmet is made out of cortosis so it was capable of shorting out lightsabers. He also has a hidden shoto lightsaber that he has later used to kill Jecki. He also killed Yord and only Sol, Osha and Mae survived.It is revealed that the mysterious Sith is Qimir. He claimed to have no name and said that he wants freedom to use the Force the way wants and not be restricted by the Jedi. He also wants an apprentice.Sol succeeds to defeat Qimir but doesn't kill him because he's unarmed. Qimir retrieves and activates his lightsaber but Osha, noticing Umbramoths above them, attaches her PIP droid to Qimir's back. Umbramoths attack him because of the light emitted by the droid. He survives the encounter with giant insects and goes to retrieve his mask. Mae disguises herself as Osha and meets Sol.There's nothing more as to the story in this episode because it was basically a group of Jedi being hunted by a Sith. The lightsaber fights were great but not as good as the ones from the prequel trilogy.

Episode 5,"If you've watched all the episodes of this show and genuinely believe this episode was less than probably a 6, I have a news flash for you: you're not a Star Wars fan, the rest of us are. So please just stop watching, and let the rest of us enjoy it.So about the episode: for the morons who insist the Sith's armor breaks canon, go to Wookiepedia and search ""Cortosis"". This material has been making appearances in Star Wars since 1998, starting with the novel ""I, Jedi"", and continuing on through many of the novels and video games of the 2000s, including ""Knights of of Old Republic"", the best Star Wars video game ever made. So I'll reiterate: if you didn't like the inclusion of this material because you incorrectly thought it breaks canon, you just don't know the canon. Sit down, and shut up.The fights: simply put, the fight scenes are excellent. This is exactly what I wanted to see out of the series. Well, maybe the Jedi can do better next time, but it's basically what I wanted.The story: Would I actually rate this episode a 10? No, I do have quibbles, but something has to be done to counteract the bots rating this a 1. Things I didn't like: using a light to attract the bugs to...ya. Bit of a cheap way out. Sol wasn't in the giant fight at the beginning, but he was there to save Osha from a thrown lightsaber? Too convenient. Then finally, the switch at the end? Also feels way too convenient to actually work.A little more defense of the episode: Mae is not constantly changing her mind for no reason. She has shown herself to be hesitant to kill these Jedi. She doesn't knife them in her sleep, she confronts them and demands they attack her first. We find out the reason she's started down this path is because she believed the Jedi killed her sister. Then she learns Osha is alive. We see her begin to question, and then decides that maybe she doesn't want to kill anymore. But it's too late, her master is there and he's in a butchering mood. So she tries to run, gets attacked by a Jedi, fights back, and keeps trying to run away. She tries to reunite with her sister, but when Osha shows she has no interest in that, she changes plans. At this point we don't know her exact plans, but everything she's done has been extremely logical to this point, mostly motivated by finding safety and/or Osha. Though again, not a big fan of the swap idea at the end.Why don't the Jedi fight better? This is a time of relative peace. Most of the fighting we've seen until now has involved avoiding lightsabers. How many of these Jedi have faced an actual opponent 1) with intent to kill 2) highly trained in combat/the force 3) using a lightsaber? Not only is the Sith a highly capable opponent, moving faster and with more power than the Jedi, but Yord mentions he's doing something to their minds. They're being attacked on every front in ways they've never faced. They've gone from fighting theory to application very fast, and that's a tough transition.Obviously.Ya, the villain reveal was a bit obvious, but I doubt any of the writers thought it would be a huge shock. Not every reveal is going to be to the level of ""I am your father."" And frankly there's a lot left to be revealed. There just might be an unexpected twist still to come. You can complain about it being predictable when it's all over.So anyway, I don't actually believe it's a perfect episode, I'm just SO TIRED of trolls and fake fans trying to ruin something the rest of us would like to enjoy.",watch episode genuinely believe episode probably 6 news flash Star Wars fan rest stop watch let rest enjoy episode moron insist Sith armor break canon Wookiepedia search Cortosis material make appearance Star Wars 1998 start novel Jedi continue novel video game 2000 include Knights Old Republic good Star Wars video game reiterate like inclusion material incorrectly think break canon know canon sit shut fight simply fight scene excellent exactly want series maybe Jedi well time basically want story actually rate episode 10 quibble counteract bot rate 1 thing like light attract bug ya bit cheap way Sol giant fight beginning save Osha throw lightsaber convenient finally switch end feel way convenient actually work little defense episode Mae constantly change mind reason show hesitant kill Jedi knife sleep confront demand attack find reason start path believe Jedi kill sister learn Osha alive begin question decide maybe want kill anymore late master butchering mood try run get attack Jedi fight keep try run away try reunite sister Osha show interest change plan point know exact plan extremely logical point motivate find safety and/or Osha big fan swap idea end Jedi fight well time relative peace fighting see involve avoid lightsaber Jedi face actual opponent 1 intent kill 2 highly train combat force 3 lightsaber Sith highly capable opponent move fast power Jedi Yord mention mind attack way face go fight theory application fast tough transition obviously Ya villain reveal bit obvious doubt writer think huge shock reveal go level father frankly lot leave reveal unexpected twist come complain predictable actually believe perfect episode tired troll fake fan try ruin rest like enjoy,NEGATIVE,0.9815053343772888
Episode 5,"After a rocky start to the series ""The Acolyte,"" the fifth episode finally reaches a level that will make fans' hearts beat faster. While the first four episodes were often characterized by long, boring passages, Episode 5 offers almost nonstop action. For Star Wars standards, this episode is surprisingly brutal, setting a clear tone for the intensity expected in the upcoming episodes.The noticeable increase in excitement and action in this episode is a welcome relief. The hectic fights and breathtaking effects almost make you forget how sluggish the series has been so far. For the first time, there is a genuine sense of anticipation for Episode 6.However, despite all the positive developments, there are still weaknesses that cannot be overlooked.

These points diminish the overall experience and sometimes leave you frustrated despite the action-packed scenes.Overall, Episode 5 of ""The Acolyte"" is a step in the right direction. The increased excitement and focus on action make it the best episode of the series so far.

Episode 5,"This show is probably the worst I have ever seen from a Star Wars project ever. Look, everyone can have an opinion, but let's be real, why the hel* was this greenlit? My main issue with this show isn't the fact that it's poorly written, as most of Star Wars is, my concern is that they are just doing whatever the hel* they want. What kind of jedi hesitates from eliminating a sith? And their padawan is stronger than them? How does that make sense? Why does it take 10 jedi to attack a sith and then they get magically carried away by bugs? The most shocking thing to me in this episode was that they killed Yord and Dafnes characters, but why? I didn't feel a connection to them. Did it shock me? While yes it did, but not because I was sad and upset that my favorite characters were killed. Rather I asked myself why? Why kill undeveloped characters in a way that would make people care? I really had a terrible time trying to follow the episode too, with the camera cutting off between fights at the moment they were getting good or making sense. It was confusing to follow each fight and honestly just made things super complicated. One thing is for sure, it was really cool to see Dafne fight with the wookies lightsaber. Btw, notice how I said wookie, I don't know the character because we only saw him for 5 minutes, and the budget of 180 million wasn't enough to see him fight? Cmon this is looking like a kindergarten kid wrote it. I mean no disrespect if you enjoy and like this story, we need more Star Wars fans after all. But I cannot fathom the idea of connecting an audience with something as divisive as this. Kathleen Kennedy must go and I mean that out of my love and devotion for this franchise. This was supposed to be a show well before the time of the skywalker saga and it has successfully undermined the story of Anakin skywalker and his redemption from Sith Lord to loving father. Don't believe me? Rewatch the original movies and then watch the prequels, and finish it off by watching this travesty. Review bomb?

Episode 5,"The hate this show gets is unwarranted. This episode in particular is fantastic, the stranger presents himself in a menacing manner, the most interesting new villain in star wars since moff gideon. The lightsaber fights are well choreographed and much better than anything in the sequels, the sets look much better than anything in Obi Wan. It doesn't refrain from killing major characters which is also a good thing.When a character like Palpatine is reintroduced, the fanbase goes wild, when the writers try something original, a new set of interesting characters, the same happens. I'm convinced the star wars fanbase will never be satisfied. Does everything have to harken back to the Sith or Vader or Tatooine and the Jedi Council to be 'Star Wars'? Because otherwise how else will this universe we all know and love expand without becoming stale?Are there any groundbreaking underlying themes or foreshadowing in this series?

Sol does his best, but he can't carry the show alone.Between the acting, the story, and the dialogue, 'The Acolyte' is really difficult to watch.

Episode 6,"Creating suspense always is an act of manipulation. The writer hints at a mystery whilst withholding important information. However, in order to keep your audience interested you need to make it believe that they're ""in"" on the secret. You need to give them just enough to think that there is an actual progression towards a release of tension, sort of like a trail of crumbs they can follow so that you can take them along your story arc.Unfortunately, this is where this show fails. There are a lot of ""mysteries"" but very few ""crumbs"" to follow. The whole story is spread very thin like way too little butter on a big slice of toast. The result is not added suspense but more a sense of bored bewilderment. You don't understand the characters' motivations, you can't connect the dots and you can't relate to the protagonists. The entire time my brain screams at he show to ""Get on with the story!"".The tragedy is that the big bad villain is played by a pretty good actor.

Episode 6,"Best episode in the show, and one of the best I've seen in general, aside from a few Disney kinks. The dialogue is actually super well done here, and Qmir reveals a ton of stuff regarding the Sith ideology. You would expect it to be poorly done by Disney, but you'd be dead wrong. The master-pupil relationship is at the heart of Star Wars, Anakin and Obi-Wan, Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine. This episode explores the Sith side of this connection, and dives deep into the power of corruption, with Qmir and Osha. It was pretty much an episode of all talking, but it isn't just meaningless filler like in some of the previous episodes. This connection between master and pupil was something that we did not see much of at all in Ahsoka between Baylen and Shin. Qmir, seemingly just some rando Sith dude as of last episode, now is a bit more complex, and I really do want to know what happened to him in the past and to Sol.

Episode 6,"After last week's explosive episode, it was only fair to assume that the budget wouldn't stretch far enough for another episode with the same amount of energy. So instead, this week feels very much like the aftermath hour that focuses a little more on furthering the story along and laying the groundwork for the final few episodes. It's still strange that there's only a few weeks left, because it doesn't really feel like the show is setting up anything huge other than some expected revelations. And the big issue with this episode is that, despite some nice character moments, it doesn't really give us anything.I will continue to bang the drum and say that this show's biggest issue lies in its writing. A lot of people have taken issue with the episode's short runtime, but if the writing is good, there is a way to actually use the time fully. This episode has a lot of unnecessary moments that simply fill out the time a little, like a hilariously bad fight scene in the middle of it. The characters are likable enough, but there's no investment in them, which makes some of the heartfelt moments fall flat. However, the episode does have some moments that elicits some emotion, and the storyline with Osha and Qimir is drawing my interest a little bit, although the fallout seems very predictable. It's nice to see that the visual aesthetic of the show has grown a bit and that they are actually using real locations, but I can't help but feel like there's a dissonance here and that a lot of these places just lack the imagination of the ""Star Wars"" worlds, plus that a lot of the places look exactly like places that we've visited before. The show isn't really interested in offering up anything new in that way, so they heavily rely on YA-level storytelling in order to keep a section of the audience interested. It's fine and it has resulted in some greatness along the way, but the show is definitely not living up to its potential, and a lot of that is because of the writing and the characterizations.""Teach / Corrupt"" is a nice little palate cleanser after it went down last episode, but it takes such a chill that it feels rather unnecessary. There are some moments of actual intrigue throughout, but the writing is so stale and dull that even the good things feel a bit rash and uninteresting when it's done.","week explosive episode fair assume budget stretch far episode energy instead week feel like aftermath hour focus little further story lay groundwork final episode strange week leave feel like set huge expect revelation big issue episode despite nice character moment continue bang drum big issue lie writing lot people take issue episode short runtime writing good way actually use time fully episode lot unnecessary moment simply fill time little like hilariously bad fight scene middle character likable investment make heartfelt moment fall flat episode moment elicit emotion storyline Osha Qimir draw interest little bit fallout predictable nice visual aesthetic grow bit actually real location help feel like dissonance lot place lack imagination Star Wars world plus lot place look exactly like place visit interested offer new way heavily rely YA level storytelling order section audience interested fine result greatness way definitely live potential lot writing characterization ""Teach Corrupt nice little palate cleanser go episode take chill feel unnecessary moment actual intrigue writing stale dull good thing feel bit rash uninteresting",NEGATIVE,0.9908732175827026

Episode 6,"It's a time of peace within the galaxy, and that's what's throwing most of not all of the brutal critiques against this beautiful story. It's slowly unfolding, but that's the way it has to unravel the plot. The daring thing about the Acolyte is the NECESSARY CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. THE CANON WAS ALREADY DEVELOPED IN PREVIOUS STAR WARS EFFORTS LIKE ASOKA AND THE BAD BATCH! You have to realize that STAR WARS has NOT technically started yet. So, we have to build up to the story much like EPISODE 4 (movie #1) has to rev up. A NOTE TO THE ACOLYTE WRITERS, HOWEVER, NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO BRIDGE THE GAP TO THE FUTURE BY LAYING THE GROUNDWORK TO INTRODUCING ESSENTIAL FUTURE CHARACTERS!!! We are dealing with a prePHANTOM MENACE framework, thus there SHOULD now be a ramping up to revealing the structure of the Sith at the time of the Acolyte, how it got there, and ALL essential players influencing the FUTURE and how their paths cross.

Episode 6,"After a major upturn in the last episode, ""The Acolyte"" settles back down a bit with this sixth episode. Though teasing the reveal of what the Jedi did on Brendok is getting a little tiresome.Osha (Amandla Stenberg) wakes up at Qimir's (Manny Jacinto) home with her wounds treated. He explains that a long time ago he was a Jedi, betrayed by his master and all he wants now is an apprentice of his own. Osha is free to leave whenever she wants, though she's tempted by his story of experiences at the hands of the order that they both share. Sol (Lee Jung-jae) gets a partial message to the Jedi Temple, getting across that his team have been killed, but not by whom. Vernestra Rwoh (Rebecca Henderson) leads a mission to Khofar but finds only the bodies as Sol, and Mae (Amadla Stenberg) have left to try and rescue Osha.In my last review, I speculated that perhaps the show was going to do the corruption of Osha and redemption of Mae arc, and it does seem like - from this episode, that is the way we're headed. It was another slower one, which perhaps is due after the non-stop sabre battles of the last episode. We do learn though, about the use of helmets amongst dark side force users and that someone was Qimir's master before he was, literally and metaphorically, stabbed in the back. It's perhaps surprising that Sol couldn't automatically sense that Mae wasn't Osha, using the Force, we can perhaps use his grief as an excuse but fortunately he does cotton on pretty quickly.There are no more wider links to the ""Star Wars"" Universe, save the classic 'English character actor appearance', more known for his comedic performances, Harry Trevaldwyn, makes his debut as unusually skittish Jedi apprentice Mog.Slower and more ponderous after last weeks fireworks, and the tease of the truth about what happened on Brendok is a groan inducing bait, but still pretty good.",major upturn episode Acolyte settle bit sixth episode tease reveal Jedi Brendok get little tiresome Osha Amandla Stenberg wake Qimir Manny Jacinto home wound treat explain long time ago Jedi betray master want apprentice Osha free leave want tempt story experience hand order share Sol Lee Jung jae get partial message Jedi Temple get team kill Vernestra Rwoh Rebecca Henderson lead mission Khofar find body Sol Mae Amadla Stenberg leave try rescue Osha review speculate go corruption Osha redemption Mae arc like episode way head slow non stop sabre battle episode learn use helmet dark force user Qimir master literally metaphorically stab surprising Sol automatically sense Mae Osha Force use grief excuse fortunately cotton pretty quickly wide link Star Wars Universe save classic english character actor appearance know comedic performance Harry Trevaldwyn make debut unusually skittish Jedi apprentice Mog slow ponderous week firework tease truth happen Brendok groan induce bait pretty good,NEGATIVE,0.9890462756156921
Episode 6,"The writers detailing more backstory and character history of the Jedi order and emergence of the Sith is an undeniably great idea. It should provoke nerdgasms in Gen X fans like myself. For me the narrative of Teach/Corrupt has some interesting moments for characters like Qimir and Osha, but it also underwhelms. The visual storytelling on the ""unknown planet"" is good and the dialogue between the two is okay. However, for me the direction of Qimir's portrayal involves some questionable creative decisions. In the previous action-focused episode he was a suitably vicious Sith Lord, whilst here in more reflective character-driven scenes he is reduced to a brooding young, pinup who appears like he's trying to act cool to impress girls. I guess it's all meant to be part of the seduction of the dark side, but for me this portrayal as a baddie lacks credibility. This might be because I am a forty-something male, but I think a young Sith should show moments of unfettered passion, rage and occasionally spit pure venom with dialogue. I do not blame Manny Jincato, who seems like a really good actor hampered by the script and direction to bring out this persona.I think other scenes are equally problematic. Lee Jung-jae deserves credit for doing his best to inject life and emotion into scenes involving Sol and Mae. One moment where he has to express anger and frustration with pure body language and facial expression is brilliant, but additionally he has some weak material to work with. Several exchanges where the dialogue simply either explains what has happened, comments on something, says how something feels or speculates what might happen feels awkward. There is little he can do to improve clunky exposition in a script.The sub-plot involving the character Vernestra feels like it's leading somewhere interesting, but scenes of her visiting previous fight scenes feel quite repetitive.The characters have not made me fully invest in The Acolyte, particularly Osha and Mae. It is not the fault of Amandla Stenberg, who does her best with the material. It feels like the mysterious past and fate of the two are being drawn out by the slow pace of the overarching narrative to the point that frustrates.Generally the visuals and art design are as great as you would expect from Star Wars, so I have no complaints there.",writer detail backstory character history Jedi order emergence Sith undeniably great idea provoke nerdgasm Gen X fan like narrative Teach Corrupt interesting moment character like Qimir Osha underwhelm visual storytelling unknown planet good dialogue okay direction Qimir portrayal involve questionable creative decision previous action focus episode suitably vicious Sith Lord whilst reflective character drive scene reduce brooding young pinup appear like try act cool impress girl guess mean seduction dark portrayal baddie lack credibility male think young Sith moment unfettered passion rage occasionally spit pure venom dialogue blame Manny Jincato like good actor hamper script direction bring persona think scene equally problematic Lee Jung jae deserve credit good inject life emotion scene involve Sol Mae moment express anger frustration pure body language facial expression brilliant additionally weak material work exchange dialogue simply explain happen comment say feel speculate happen feel awkward little improve clunky exposition script sub plot involve character Vernestra feel like lead interesting scene visit previous fight scene feel repetitive character fully invest Acolyte particularly Osha Mae fault Amandla Stenberg good material feel like mysterious past fate draw slow pace overarching narrative point frustrate generally visual art design great expect Star Wars complaint,NEGATIVE,0.8913126587867737
Episode 6,"Let's start with a fundamental question: What are they looking for? Neither they nor we know what they want or what they are searching for. Because if their goal is to present a good audiovisual experience, they are not achieving it. If it's to tell a good story or develop a solid narrative, they are failing. If they aim to impress with striking design and spectacular color composition, they are not succeeding. If they want to showcase their skills with special effects, they are falling short. And if their purpose is to show us epic, fictional battles, they are not delivering.But there's something they do very well: political maneuvering and selling their image. They excel at that. So, let's analyze this with the seven basic points used to evaluate any audiovisual production.First, the story. Is it good? It's terrible, a disastrous story. Zero merit in this narrative. Next, let's analyze the composition and design. I'd give it a 3 or 4; it's very average work. The acting deserves a zero. Where do they find these actors? What experience do they have? Direction is another weak point. This director, what has she directed before? What has she done to deserve a project with such a high budget? It's a series that looks cheap, yet it has a high cost.Hopefully, Disney realizes that continuing to present this type of production can lead them to ruin. They are wasting money and, worse, brainwashing us with superficial ideas. In the end, the products are garbage. Star Wars is completely dead. No one cares anymore. And yet, they keep releasing series and products of poor quality. Who approves this? Who in their right mind greenlights such a disaster? It makes no sense.",let start fundamental question look know want search goal present good audiovisual experience achieve tell good story develop solid narrative fail aim impress striking design spectacular color composition succeed want showcase skill special effect fall short purpose epic fictional battle deliver political maneuvering sell image excel let analyze seven basic point evaluate audiovisual production story good terrible disastrous story zero merit narrative let analyze composition design 3 4 average work acting deserve zero find actor experience direction weak point director direct deserve project high budget series look cheap high cost hopefully Disney realize continue present type production lead ruin waste money bad brainwash superficial idea end product garbage Star Wars completely dead care anymore release series product poor quality approve right mind greenlight disaster make sense,NEGATIVE,0.9008773565292358

Episode 7,"I previously reviewed episode 3 optimistically because there were a series of events that were left unexplained and made me excited for the possibility of a deeper darker side of the Jedi. However, this most recent episode retread the same episode from a different perspective without actually adding anything.Before I really get into my review, I will say that the strongest part of the episode was the fight with Kelnacca. With all my reservations about the production of this show, I think it Ali's awesome that they allowed the same actor who brought Chewbacca back is able to portray a terrifying and powerful Wookie Jedi.Myain issue with this episode and the story this entire show is meant to be based on is that everything turned out to be good intentions and misunderstandings that led to accidentally killing the space with when she turned into black CGI space mist.It's not like this is the worse thing they could have written, but it doesn't add anything about the Jedi from that time.Perhaps it's because I haven't read any of the ""High Republic"" novels that this show is based around, but it feels as if all the Jedi at too ""good"" to be the same order that falls due to their own hubris only 100 years later.I actually like the character of Sol, but it feels like his future level of remorse, plus him never telling Osha what really happened, seems a little off for this explanation.I really wanted Disney to push that not all Jedi were perfect and good, or that they were good according to their own definition and self interests.Imagine a different version where instead of the council telling them not to interfere, they command the team to destroy the coven because they draw on the dark side and threaten to bring the force out of balance. That would be a compelling moral struggle of the Jedi who were there and would further justify Mae's missing for revenge.This is not the final episode, so I am hoping for a satisfying conclusion, but this episode puts a stain on the entire premise.",previously review episode 3 optimistically series event leave unexplained excited possibility deeply dark Jedi recent episode retread episode different perspective actually add review strong episode fight Kelnacca reservation production think Ali awesome allow actor bring Chewbacca able portray terrifying powerful Wookie Jedi myain issue episode story entire mean base turn good intention misunderstanding lead accidentally kill space turn black CGI space mist like bad thing write add Jedi time read High Republic novel base feel Jedi good order fall hubris 100 year later actually like character Sol feel like future level remorse plus tell Osha happen little explanation want Disney push Jedi perfect good good accord definition self interest imagine different version instead council tell interfere command team destroy coven draw dark threaten bring force balance compelling moral struggle Jedi justify Mae missing revenge final episode hope satisfying conclusion episode put stain entire premise,POSITIVE,0.9354436993598938

Only Sol killed the mother who couldn't simply say ok i let Osha go with you, instead turned into a smoke banshee demon creature and started to turn Mae into dust so obviously Sol thought something terrible is happening and stopped her.So let's talk about the rest of the jedi..
Kelnacca did absolutely nothing, other than walking around with a metal detector..He was mind controlled and did not hurt a single witch..Torbin who killed himself. He did nothing his only guilt was being bored on a planet as a kid..did not hurt a single witch either. So episode two is pretty much dumb..Indara.

The impact of Mother Aniseya's accidentally murder was also subtle, but powerful.

Episode 7,"There is little plot detail I can reveal without spoiling. It is safe to say that for me it gives another perspective on a previous episode that makes sense, but I think it also highlights the weakness in certain creative choices made to possibly stretch the season out longer than it needs to be.Without mentioning specifics it reminds me of Star Trek and in particular the prime directive focussed episodes and the potential impact of interference or cultural contamination. I do like the idea of conflict between diverse groups of force users who interpret the same power in a different way. However, witches and possession tropes feel slightly out of place and I have a hard time getting round it. That being said, the Jedi being flawed individuals getting into this type of conflict is a fresh and interesting idea within Star Wars.Maybe if the dialogue was better (""Get Mad"" etc,) and the characters were more engaging I would invest more into the story. The pace has not helped it. Some plots can unfold slowly, like Andor, and be compelling, but this is a struggle at times. I do not think the backstory aspect of the plot needed to be strung out over two episodes. The initial ""half-a-story"" flashback in the episode Destiny was unnecessary and it all should have been revealed here.Some of the acting is pretty good, though it is a mixed bag.

Episode 7,"I've been watching ""The Acolyte"" one week behind, which has cost me a little bit in terms of the shows most dramatic reveals. So, ahead of the final episode this week, I decide to sneak in episode seven so I can, at least, watch it on the right day.We return to the events of Brendok and see the rest of the story that we didn't' already know. The Jedi exploration team discover the existence of the Coven and, against the instruction of the Jedi Order, continue to investigate the twins. Coming to believe that the vergence that they are looking for, and eager to get home, Torbin (Dean-Charles Chapman) charges to liberate them, with Sol (Lee Jung-jae) in pursuit. Events take a tragic turn and Sol is left with a difficult choice.I again don't want to sacrifice too many of my time in arguing against other people's opinions but one of the prevailing ones I saw was that ""Jedi are bad now"". That seems to me to be a particularly basic reading of what happens here. The Jedi are dealing with a force that they don't really understand and so react with fear, confusion and as a result of some corruption, to what happens. They are not, as I thought might be the case, responsible for the destruction of the temple or the slaughter of all of the witches - in fact I'm less clear on exactly what happened to the rest of the coven. It does now make sense why Mae has targeted the Jedi and why Torbin thought that they perhaps deserved it though. They did, after all, decide to cover up what happened.It's interesting to see where the show can go from here, if it is going to end this week or run on longer. The intention at least must have been to go on as sure the redemption/descent arcs of Mae and Osha can't be resolved in so little time.

There is also something else that is brought up, and it's the balance between the good and bad.Every main character deals with this. Mae just wanted revenge for her mother.

Episode 8,"The arc of Osha and Mae has been a long drawn out affair and although the resolution is decent, it feels overdue. There are not many plot specifics I can reveal without spoiling but it's safe to say that it concludes the first series with a good mix of Jedi action and character moments.For me the flaws of the Jedi are used to create some fairly good drama like in prequel trilogy, but the central characters (aside from Sol) have been less interesting than those on the periphery like Vernestra. The highlight of this episode by far is *what it implied could have been coming in a second season. There are two moments that tease certain characters that are very effective, * but we know it leads nowhere.Like previous episodes the dialogue is problematic. So much is over-explained by the show's characters in various scenes it goes beyond frustrating to the point where I am numb to it. I am guessing this is for a target younger audience in whose ability to interpret a plot the writers show little confidence.For me the standout performer is Lee Jung-jae who convincingly presents a tortured soul and contends with simplistic exposition dialogue in recently learned language. This has to be admired. I also enjoyed the cameo by David Harewood, who plays the part well and delivers one iconic line with the appropriate sarcasm required.The biggest disappointment for me was one key moment of a character who fully changes before our eyes with an act of vengeance. This should have been done with much more passion, obvious anger and vindictiveness befitting the dark side of the force. Unfortunately it is quite bland and emotionless. I do not blame the actor, as the director should have controlled it better. Additionally, Manny Jacinto does not convince me as a Sith Lord. I might be a bluff old traditionalist, but attempting to turn this type of baddie into a cool, pin-up type does not work at all for me personally. This character's dialogue harps on about emotions being a source of power, yet he is portrayed as pretty bland in my opinion.All the visuals and sounds are very good as you would expect from Star Wars.

I would have liked to have seen more of a duel. The end of season 1 has been more of a back story or origin or birth of the vergence and season 2 will explore the culmination of this so I am very excited.The one thing I liked in this show was that they weren't afraid to let characters die, star wars shows have been a little afraid recently of killing off characters and now this show has pulled some punches. I found this to be much better than mandorlorian season 3. This had story and evolving characters and a continuing story arc that you could see progressing into the foreseeable and leaving us with stuff to talk about such as the glowing eyed creature in the hut. Why the events were kept secret and a certain tease at the end.Some cons..This episode had some dodgy dialogue but so does alot of Star Wars. The episode could have been more climatic. There could have been a few more examples as to why the events of this season were kept secret.Star wars needs to come back to the cinema! Disney needs to stop cowering in the corner with TV shows and ruining the pacing with short episodes. As soon as you got into most episodes of the Acolyte it was about to end. It would have been much better as a film. In total this series is about 4hours... With a bit of editing we have a film and a good light Vs dark story about the vergence of the force.Off topic but related to current Disney schemesStories shouldn't be forced into gender roles. It should be about the characters. Disney seem to be forcing female characters. I've enjoyed the Acolyte and even Rey (she just wasn't written well)A story can be about male or female characters or even working together or even aliens if we're talking about Star Wars. It's great to see female centric leads but forcing it constantly seems more of an agenda than doing it for the story. We're all equal and so the stories that are created should be men and women working together. The Acolyte has done well with show casing male characters too but it shouldn't be forgotten Star wars is about equality just like Star Trek.Anyway overall I just look forward to seeing Star Wars coming back to the cinema ive had enough of TV shows. Bring Acolyte to the big screen or maybe make High Republic movies!!!

Episode 8,"The final episode stands out as one of the better epidoses and the closest to capturing the essence of Star Wars. Its atmosphere is compelling, though it's unfortunate that this level of immersion only appears in the concluding chapter. This should have been established much earlier in the series.The series' primary issue is its writing. The scripts lack depth, and the conceptual planning is disastrous for a project of this scale. There isn't a coherent story being told, and the characters are poorly developed, making it difficult to connect with any of them. Additionally, the series frequently disregards established Star Wars canon, though that topic has been extensively debatedIn summary, while the last episode offers a glimpse of what could have been, it arrives too late to redeem the series as a whole. Star Wars: The Acolyte had potential, but it was ultimately let down by poor writing and execution.",final episode stand well epidose close capture essence Star Wars atmosphere compelling unfortunate level immersion appear conclude chapter establish early series series primary issue writing script lack depth conceptual planning disastrous project scale coherent story tell character poorly develop make difficult connect additionally series frequently disregard establish Star Wars canon topic extensively debatedIn summary episode offer glimpse arrive late redeem series Star war Acolyte potential ultimately let poor writing execution,NEGATIVE,0.9248144626617432
Episode 8,"Bad acting, bad directing, bad writing, and bad production are what define this series. So its not a surprised this episode is the same. Situations occur, as it did with the episode before, that were suppose to be shocking, but they weren't. Its not shocking because you know they were going to happen, and they were written poorly and occur for no logical reason other than they wanted to write a shock or they wrote themselves into a corner. We already saw that the Jedi did nothing wrong, that there is no reason to cover up anything, and they were clearly defending themselves. But the writers continue to push this false and illogical narrative that they did. It's just lazy and bad writing. Just like how people constantly swing their motivations in changing directions for no real reason other than the shove the plot along. The writers are literally telling us, ""Look, the Jedi are bad, that is the way it is and I can't think of why or how they are, just accept it. Stop criticizing me for my lack of skill in writing. You're the problem, not me."" The show as a whole is just horrible.

Episode 8,"After a terrible start, especially with episode 3 (boy, this was terrible), the story gets more and more an enjoyable. It would have been way better to replace episode 3 with episode 7 which would bring some meaningful action to the whole show. Despite all the bad screenwriting and backdrops, the whole story is not as bad as people ant it be. The idea is really good and it get more into a form the last 3 episodes. For a second season, Dave Filoni needs to oversee the whole thing to make it work, because the current screenwriting and craftsmanship is not nearly the quality standards that expects from Star Wars.",terrible start especially episode 3 boy terrible story get enjoyable way well replace episode 3 episode 7 bring meaningful action despite bad screenwriting backdrop story bad people ant idea good form 3 episode second season Dave Filoni need oversee thing work current screenwriting craftsmanship nearly quality standard expect Star Wars,NEGATIVE,0.5008686184883118
Episode 8,"This season of ""The Acolyte"" draws to a close with more reveals, more deaths, and a tie in (or perhaps two) with the wider Star Wars Story.Mae (Amandla Stenberg) escapes from Sol (Lee Jung-jae) and crashes an escape ship in Brendok, Sol follows her, and they meet at the ruins of the coven's fortress. Osha (Amandla Stenberg) has a vision of Mae's location and, despite having different outcomes in mind, agrees to travel to Brendok with Qimir (Manny Jacinto). Before landing, Sol turns his transponder on allowing Vernestra (Rebecca Henderson) to gather another troop of Jedi Knights and head to Brendok as well, hoping to bring the situation to a conclusion before Senator Reyencourt (David Harewood) can convince the senate that the Jedi need oversight. With all the characters in the same location, truths are learned and fates are determined.Interestingly, I think that how I feel about this particular episode might come down to whether or not there is a second season of the show. It's pacier than the show has been as a whole, and the fight between Sol and Qimir is another great sabre fight, in a series that has ended up having quite a few good ones. It doesn't end on a cliffhanger but does feel to me like it's only the start of the story. I want to know who, if anyone, will rise from the Jedi ranks to oppose Qimir and Osha and how they will continue to keep it quiet.It's intriguing to consider if that character hiding in the shadows of Qimir's hideout is Darth Plagueis and how that fits into the wider lore. Though again I'd argue in principle that there's a need to get away from the Skywalker Saga to open up Star Wars to new stories, I also have to admit that I had felt a thrill at that moment, and in the very final moment of the series.It'll be very interesting to see Lucasfilm's appetite for a second season. We don't know much about actual viewing figures and the legitimate criticism of the series hasn't been as glowing as it was for say ""Andor"" - only time will tell.",season Acolyte draw close reveal death tie wide Star Wars Story Mae Amandla Stenberg escape Sol Lee Jung jae crash escape ship Brendok Sol follow meet ruin coven fortress Osha Amandla Stenberg vision Mae location despite have different outcome mind agree travel Brendok Qimir Manny Jacinto landing Sol turn transponder allow Vernestra Rebecca Henderson gather troop Jedi Knights head Brendok hope bring situation conclusion Senator Reyencourt David Harewood convince senate Jedi need oversight character location truth learn fate determine interestingly think feel particular episode come second season paci fight Sol Qimir great sabre fight series end have good one end cliffhanger feel like start story want know rise Jedi rank oppose Qimir Osha continue quiet intriguing consider character hide shadow Qimir hideout Darth Plagueis fit wide lore argue principle need away Skywalker Saga open Star Wars new story admit feel thrill moment final moment series It'll interesting Lucasfilm appetite second season know actual view figure legitimate criticism series glowing Andor time tell,POSITIVE,0.7263292074203491

Episode 8,"You know how most season finale's tend to wrap-up the various plotlines, bringing together multiple separate threads into a satisfying revelation, perhaps leaving a few open to setup the next series? Not this show!The Acolyte ends by just making its own story pointless and meaningless. Characters completely change their world view and allegiances in an instant. They use cheap tactics like mind-wiping to get rid of plot inconveniences. Then the show just ends. A few people have died, a few people have changed sides and that's it.The thought The Acolyte left me with was ""what was the point of all of that?""Side note: Amandla Stenberg fighting herself might just be the worst action scene I've ever seen. I can understand the challenges posed with having to stitch together two shots of an actor fighting to make it look like their fighting themselves but the choreography is AWFUL and Amandla looks so wooden and awkward.
